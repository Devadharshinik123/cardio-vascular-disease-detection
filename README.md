# cardio-vascular-disease-detection
Cardiovascular Disease Detection is a project designed to identify or predict the risk of cardiovascular conditions using health data and advanced technologies like machine learning or data analysis. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses, improving patient outcomes through early intervention. This project benefits patients by offering insights into their cardiovascular health and supports hospitals in enhancing efficiency and resource management. Researchers can also use it to uncover patterns and factors contributing to heart diseases, paving the way for innovative treatment approaches. The ultimate goal is to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.
